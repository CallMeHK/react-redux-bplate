## What is this?

This is a quick redux cheatsheet I made for myself using both class based and functional components.  The patterns arent perfect but the ideas are all here.  There are 4 examples of components connected to redux here:

 - The root component, App
 - Class based component ClassCount
 - Functional component using `react-redux-hooks` package, FuncCount
 - Functional component using custom `useCount` hook, CustomHookCount

Todo: add a few more examples outside of count, like input fields and stuff.
